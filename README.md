Nearly empty java project with a failing test!
===

This has been created using gradle; to run the tests, just execute:

```
./gradlew test
```

or (on windows machines):

```
gradlew.bat test
```

**DO NOT change the names of the function (GetCheapestHotel) or of the file and folder it is in, changing it implies in disqualification.** 

**After implementing your solution, it should pass the unit tests available.**
